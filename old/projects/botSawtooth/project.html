        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Sawtooth is the name of an AI I created for the <a href="https://terminal.c1games.com/"> Terminal games</a> - an international artificial intelligence competition by <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/"> Correlation One</a>. My AI was able to quickly climb to the top of the leaderboards against over 30,000 AI's submitted by over 10,000 players. I later made a few small upgrades to sawtooth releasing a SawtoothV2. Beyond just reaching the top of the leaderboards Sawtooth also won the Terminal CodeBullet competition against over 600 submitted AI's. In the image above the blue side showcases Sawtooth's design.</p>

        <p>When I created Sawtooth the only language supported by the game was Python - a language that at the time I had no experience with. In order to create my AI I had to teach myself an entirely new programming language and redo a lot of my old Java code in Python. I even ended up creating a simple code generator to convert help me move from Java to Python. Although frustrating it allowed me a great opportunity to teach myself a new skill.</p>

        <p>I had plans to continue working on a SawtoothV3 and had even taken the time to create my own Java simulator for the game so I could run games locally. Unfortunately after sinking many hours and over 5000 lines of code into a new AI I became busy with school and I still haven't had a clear stretch of time to get back into it.</p>

        <p>Below is a screenshot I took shortly after SawtoothV2 was able to overtake the previously highest rated algorithm on the leaderboards.</p>
