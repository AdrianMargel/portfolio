          <!-- <li><p><a href="TODO">demo</a></p></li> -->

        <p>This program simulates the formation of a simple 3D solar system. When the simulation starts there are a huge number of tiny little micro-planets, overtime these micro-planets collide and merge with each other until there are only a few large planets left orbiting the sun.</p>

        <p>The program is able to simulate gravitational attraction and simple planetary collisions by merging the two planets into a single mass. This means that the program is general and can be adapted to run a large range of scenarios beyond just solar system formation. Possible examples include binary star systems, black holes, collisions between solar systems, etc.</p>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>

        <p>This was inspired by a demo project in my highschool computer science class. The teacher was showing a demo on how to create a simple solar system using rotations to the class. I had already mastered the skills he planned on teaching through that demo on my own and so found myself extremely bored. I decided to keep myself entertained that I would make a more advanced solar system simulation.</p>

        <h2>Creation</h2>

        <p>As stated above, this was inspired by a simple demo my computer science teacher did with the class in highschool. The example the teacher was doing just had a simple method that would rotate planets around a central point - this was the first thing to go. I quickly scrapped the simple rotation method for an equation able to calculate gravitational attraction. After this I decided that the two dimensions we were using in class weren't enough, so I added a new dimension, the third dimension! This was all fine but planets would still just phase through each other when they collided. So I gave planets the ability to collide with each other merging into larger planets - all while conserving mass and energy of course. At this point I increased the number of planets from just a few planets to a few hundred. I then watched as these hundreds of small planets collide and merge with one another until only a small handful of large planets remained orbiting the sun.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>

        <p>Below are examples of the simulated formation of a solar system. Keep in mind that although the sun looks small it has a much higher density than the planets do.</p>
